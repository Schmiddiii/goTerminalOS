# goTerminalOS

A not so serious operating system written in go running in the terminal.

## Installation

Just download it and build it with `go build .` and execute the generated file.

## Starting

When starting the operating system you will see an open window dedicated to show you help. To execute the commands just type them in and hit enter.  
You can for example open a notetaking window, switch between windows or move windows around. Just test it out and have fun.

## Examples for commands

- `d` shows the desktop
- `s 4` will switch to the fourth window you have opened
- `c` will close the window
- `w Hello` will write Hello into the opened notetaking window
- `shutdown` will close the terminal
